# Post Views Restrictions

Article & Webinar Restrictions for Public and Guest Members
As part of this deployment, the platform will limit public users of the site to 3 articles or webinars per month, based on the first date the user viewed an article or webinar, then 30 days from that point.  Category pages do not count, only articles and webinars.  Once the user has read 3 articles or webinars per month (based on a cookie system), the user will not be able to read further without subscribing.  One can see this in the Article (restricted) view in the Figma.

Note that once a user subscribes as a guest, this limit changes to 5 articles or webinars per 30 days, but otherwise, the user will be similarly restricted to those that are public

Public and guest users may not access the OEM directory
